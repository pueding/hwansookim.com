# Hello, I'm Hwansoo Kim

## Software Engineer

Welcome to my personal blog. I'm a software engineer who writes about leadership, management, and technology.

I share thoughts and lessons learned throughout my career, particularly focusing on:

- **Leadership** - Building trust-based management
- **Team Collaboration** - Creating environments where people want to work
- **Technology** - Software engineering insights
- **Life Lessons** - Perspectives I want to share with my children

This blog contains posts written primarily in Korean, sharing insights from my experience in the tech industry.

You can find my Korean blog posts using the "Korean Blog" link in the navigation above - these contain life lessons and insights written for my son and daughter.
